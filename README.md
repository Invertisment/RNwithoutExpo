## What this repo is talking about ##

Sometimes we need to have more control about dependencies.

This project can be used as a reference to your lastest React Native applications without expo SDK.

## Get Started ##

1. Download the project directly or use `git clone`.
2. Install all dependencies with `npm i` command or `yarn`, as you prefer.
3. Start the JS remote debugging with `npm start`
4. Run the application on android with `npm run android`

Enjoy! =)
